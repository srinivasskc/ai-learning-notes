## 🔑 Key Notes
- 🏗️ **Foundation Models**

The big, general-purpose models are trained on massive, broad data (text, images, audio, etc.).

Example: GPT-4, LLaMA, Gemini, Claude.

- 📖 **LLMs (Large Language Models)**

A type of foundation model specialized in language.

Example: GPT-4 (ChatGPT’s engine), Gemini Pro, Claude 3, Mistral Medium.

- 🚀 **Deployed AI Model**

This is the real-world version of a model that’s made available for people or businesses to actually use.

When researchers train a foundation model or an LLM, it’s very large, raw, and often not directly usable.

To make it practical, companies or teams deploy the model:

Wrap it inside an app, API, or chatbot.

Add guardrails (safety, ethics, filtering).

Optimize it for performance (speed, memory, scale).

Connect it to a user interface (like ChatGPT, Copilot, Bard, Gemini apps).

👉 **In short:**

- Foundation Model = the general intelligence base.

- LLM = one specialist under that base (focused on text).

- Deployed AI Model = the finished, usable product that you and I can interact with in apps, websites, or devices.

✅ **Example in context:**

GPT-4 → is the foundation model (an LLM).

ChatGPT app → is the deployed AI model, which uses GPT-4 (and sometimes GPT-3.5) to interact with you.
