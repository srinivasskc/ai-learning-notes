## 🔑 Key Notes
🚀 **Foundation Models vs Large Language Models (LLMs): What’s the Connection?**

- Recently I got to know about a term **Foundational AI Models**.
I wanted to understand what is the relationship between Foundational AI Models vs LLMs. — are both the same? 🤔

- 🏗️ **Foundation Models**
The big, general-purpose models trained on massive, broad data (text, images, audio, etc.).
Example: GPT, CLIP, DALL·E, Whisper etc.

- 📖 **LLMs (Large Language Models)**
A special type of foundation model specialized only on language (text). They understand and generate human-like text.
Example: GPT, Claude, LLaMA, PaLM, Gemini.

👉 So, every LLM is a Foundation Model, but not every Foundation Model is an LLM.

Example: 
Mistral Medium 3 is an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) with state-of-the-art reasoning, knowledge, coding and vision capabilities.

- **Mistral Medium 3** is both:
A Large Language Model (LLM) (because it specializes in text/language tasks).
A Foundation Model (because it’s broad, general-purpose, and adaptable — part of the foundation model family).
